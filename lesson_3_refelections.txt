1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
 When collaborating with others this way you can share your work easily.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 You might not want to pull a change until you have ensured that your code is free of code error.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  a) Forks are making copies of someone's projects.
  b) Clone create a local copy on your computer.
  c) Branches are paths that point you in the direction to your next location.

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
 You always have something to look back and compare it to.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
 Doc files, email, cloud based platform. To an extent harder.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
 You want to make changes in a separate branch in order to initiate a pull request from GitHub.
A pull request will allow other people to collaborate, comment, and add code to your project.
It allows programming in a social ecosystem where input from others is highly desirable and
supported. On the other hand, changes directly in master may mean that you are the lone
user of a project who would like to track changes over time. Branch changes invites collaboration.
Direct master changes allows tracking over time.
